Hi! I'm a final-year undergraduate at University of Pennsylvania, where I study mathematics. My research interests lies in the intersection between computer science and neuroscience.

The main question that motivates me to start research in the intersection of Neuro/AI is, if itâ€™s possible for us to reverse engineer how the brain solves computational problems with mathematical language of computational learning theory? In particular, I want to understand the theory of learning and perception and implement learning algorithms that align with biological plausible structures.
